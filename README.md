# RedMetal

This is my Unreal Engine project.

1. Implement floating text and icon display with proximity trigger on pickup items
2. Implement a primary weapon
3. Create custom ammo pickup models
4. Create simple westen landscape to replace default box setting
5. Create dummy that can take
6. Reparent weapon base to Pickup base to inherit text identifier logic
