# RedMetal

This is my Unreal Engine project.

1. **DONE** Implement floating text and icon display with proximity trigger on pickup items
2. Implement a primary weapon
3. Create custom ammo pickup models
4. Create simple westen landscape to replace default box setting
5. Create dummy that can take damage
6. **DONE** Reparent weapon base to Pickup base to inherit text identifier logic
7. Improve "floating text" above pickup (#1 above) items so they are UI elements and not rendered text in the world
